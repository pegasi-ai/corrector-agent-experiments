# Ama Waterways represents a unique opportunity to acquire a scarce and scaled brand, with low awareness and strong economics, operating in the scaled, growing, and fundamentally attractive river cruise category

\> As a reminder, there are currently 2 other parties (1 strategic and 1 sponsor-backed strategic) in the process. To ensure our time and resources were spent
prudently, we agreed to a $1.70B EqV ($1.54B TEV) in exchange for certainty and an accelerated process to signing

\> Since our last update, we have focused on (i) refining our Value Creation Plan, (ii) continuing to build a strong relationship and alignment with founders (Rudi
Schreiner, Kristin Karst, and the Murphy family), (iii) completing confirmatory diligence (no red flags), and (iv) documentation (target signing on 2/21). We
continue to learn more that excites us about the upside

· Travel Agent Channel: Ama has steadily increased its penetration of individual travel agencies underneath their top 3 travel agent consortia, which collectively comprise
52% of 2023A travel agent bookings, in-line with those consortia's market share. However, material whitespace remains (Travel Leaders Network @ ~10%, Virtuoso @
~50%, Signature @ ~50%), supporting our growth expectations

" Direct Channel: Ama has already started to focus on the direct channel and while still nascent, the Company's direct capabilities are farther along than we anticipated

\- Material increases in marketing ($16M in 2019A, $25M in 2023A, $28M/$32M in 2024E Mgmt/Base Case) with shift towards digital channels, though focus
largely still in bottom funnel with significant opportunity to optimize under our ownership (e.g., inefficient agency spend, technology/infrastructure limitations)

\- VP of Marketing, Michal Maguire, has a solid grasp on the marketing operation and the correct instincts and aspirations, but we expect to augment her with a
best-in-class CMO to define and drive the broader marketing strategy (in partnership with LCAT MADE)

\- Launched online consumer booking engine in Dec'23 and increased internal direct sales team (based on inbound inquiries to date) from ~5 to ~35 (though still
not enough capacity), which coupled with increases in digital marketing has driven recent mix of direct bookings to ~17.5% (vs ~10% in 2023A)

Ama continues to perform strongly on its 2024 booking curves with strong pricing holding, providing confidence in achieving in 2024E Base Case Occupancy
Rate of 87.0% and Adj. EBITDA of $170M (refined through vessel-by-vessel build with no other material changes from prior conservative Base Case)

" As of 1/31/24, 2024 Occupancy Rates have accelerated past 2019 at the Same Time Last Year ("STLY"), which ended at 85.2% (vs 2024E Base Case of 87.0%)

· Further, as of 1/15/24, Net Revenue per Passenger is +11.3% vs 2023 STLY (vs 2024E Base Case Net Cruise Yield growth of +5.4%)

· 2023 Mgmt. Adj. EBITDA at $111M (vs. $116M prior), driven almost entirely by unfavorable FX (mostly unrealized; forecasted at 1.08 vs 1.10 on 12/31 and 1.08 today)

At a $1.70B EqV ($1.54B TEV), our conservative Base Case returns a 2.74x MOIC / 24% IRR, with multiple actional levers to generate outsized returns

· A $1.54B TEV implies 9.1x/8.2x 2024E Base Case/Mgmt Adj. EBITDA (vs current avg public comps of 9.3x)

" Assumes 4.8x 3rd party gross leverage ($525M TLB and $75M revolver undrawn at close), PF ownership for rolling founder shareholders of 15%, and conservative Base
Case assumptions (2027E Adj. EBITDA of $234M vs Mgmt of $301M)

· Given significant EBITDA growth in 2024E, we have been conservative with closing leverage and intend to execute a dividend recapitalization within 12 months to
reduce basis (conservatively estimating $150M, implying a LTM Q1 2025E gross / net leverage of 4.1x / 3.3x vs gross leverage of 4.8x at closing)

· Strong FCF generation provides optionality (addt'l div recap / interim distributions) - we have modeled interim distributions above 2x net leverage (+0.4% IRR impact) 2

# Ama offers an attractive risk/reward and allows us to acquire a leading player in a highly attractive category

Attractive and
Resilient
Category


## River cruise is a large, fundamentally attractive, and resilient category

" ~$7B category that has normalized post-COVID and is forecasted to grow ~6% per annum, driven by strong and enduring secular
tailwinds, including (i) favorably shifting demographics, (ii) a rise in awareness for the category, (iii) heightened demand for adventure-
focused and small-group travel, (iv) experiences over goods, (v) premiumization, and (vi) increasing demand from non-US consumers

· High visibility of revenue due to forward booking nature of category, allowing operators to adapt quickly to demand patterns

· Resiliency and rapid recovery from macroeconomic factors and predictable / manageable as evidenced during COVID


## Exceptional Economics


### Exceptional and industry-leading vessel-level economics and strong FCF conversion

· Despite macroeconomic factors, 2023A average vessel generated $18M in Total Net Revenue, 42% Vessel-level EBITDA ("VLEBITDA"),
and 46%+ ROICs with no unprofitable vessels; 2024 booking curves indicate a strong and full recovery to pre-COVID occupancy rates
· Significant flow through on pricing (100%) and incremental passengers (~80%) with low breakeven occupancy rates (~30%)

· Strong FCF conversion profile (~65% in 2018-2019) with favorable working capital profile (collection of customer deposits for future
sailings), enabling optionality for a dividend recap or interim distributions

Strong Brand


### Leading brand offering tremendous scarcity value

· Strong consumer satisfaction (NPS and Future Purchase Intent amongst highest of premium peers) with differentiating qualities around
small & intimate experiences, high-quality dining, personalized customer service, and variety of excursions & active and wellness offerings

" Leading brand affinity coupled with low awareness (Ama at 55% vs Viking at 91%) provides significant opportunity to capitalize on
strong latent consumer demand via accretive direct marketing investments

" Consumers display stronger loyalty than peers, allowing Ama to retain customers and drive LTV after their first river cruise experience

Advantaged
Distribution
with Significant
Opportunity


### Historically leveraged travel agents as a distribution channel with significant opportunity to expand direct channel

· Strong relationships with travel agents and strong consumer satisfaction lead travel agents to recommend Ama more with ~30% of
passengers choosing Ama based on their travel agent's recommendations

· As proven by Viking (est. ~ 50% direct), significant opportunity to expand direct channel while avoiding channel conflicts, enabling (i)
higher Occupancy Rates, Revenue per Passenger, and profitability, (ii) structural loyalty, and (iii) enhanced strategic / enterprise value


## Attractive Return Profile


## Asymmetric return profile with limited downside and numerous levers to drive outsized returns

· Multiple levers to drive outsized returns, including (i) accelerated fleet growth to capture significant whitespace opportunity, (ii) further
expanding direct channel to drive strategic / enterprise value, (iii) unique luxury partnerships, including with LVMH, and (iv) strategic
M&A to expand into different product offerings, price tiers, or geographies in a low-risk manner

" Category resilience and robust industry growth limit potential downsides

" Scarcity value given lack of scaled, independent, and premium & luxury assets in category

At an entry TEV / EqV of $1.54B / $1.70B, 4.8x pro forma gross leverage, and 15% pro forma ownership for
rollover founder shareholders, our Common Equity check would be ~$890M


## Transaction Overview

\> LCAT acquires Ama at a TEV of $1.54B and EqV of $1.70B

\> Assumes 4.8x gross leverage on LTM Q1 2024E QoE Adj. EBITDA of $109M

· $525M Term Loan B (@ S+375, 7-year, cov-lite) and $75M revolver (undrawn at close)

\> Given significant EBITDA growth in 2024E, we've been conservative with closing leverage
and intend to execute a div recap within 12 mos to reduce basis (returns assume recap)

· Conservatively estimating $150M, implying a LTM Q1 2025E gross / net leverage of
4.1x / 3.3x

\> Assumes existing founder shareholders (Rudi, Kristin, and Murphy Family) roll $157M,
implying ~15% pro forma ownership

· Remaining $889M of equity will be held by LCAT and co-investors, with potential
participation from LCE

\> Assumes interim distributions above 2.0x net leverage given strong FCF

\> Exit multiple of ~9.5x NTM Adj. EBITDA, in-line with entry (~9.1x) and current public
peers (~9.3x) and below 2015-2019 average public comps (~10.5x)

APT: 3 vessels return to service under Ama, resulting in increased revenue across both Net Cruise
Revenue and Other Revenue items (e.g., Air, Pre/Post, etc.), creating incomparability on % of Total Net
Revenue. Notably, VLEBITDA Margin % in 2025E is conservative relative to historical performance

2
VLEBITDA Margin: conservative and only slightly above 2019 margins despite higher Occupancy Rates
and expected improvements in pricing strategy

3
G&A: 2024E decline as % of Total Net Revenue driven by right-sizing of contact center and shift to
offshore labor for certain departments. Corresponding spike in 2025 due to incremental costs from APT
vessels returning to Ama, in addition to investments to build RPP and DTC capabilities


4
Adj. EBITDA Margin: conservative and below peak 2019 margins driven by SG&A investments

## Commentary

•
Occupancy Rates: reflects incremental EBITDA contribution in exit year attributable to Occupancy Rates returning to pre-COVID levels (76% in '23A > 88% in '28E)

•
Capacity / New Vessel Expansion: reflects incremental EBITDA contribution from increased capacity stemming from new vessel growth (25 in '23A > 33 in '28E
total vessels; 4 fully owned and operated and 4 non-fully owned and operated vessels; 5 in core European rivers and 3 in exotic-destinations), expansion of operational days per vessel, and the
return of three APT vessels to Ama's service

•
Net Pricing: assumes ~3.6% Net Cruise Yield '23A-'28E CAGR (~2.4% from pricing, ~0.3% from increase in Direct mix, and ~0.9% from RPP investments) and even
lower growth of Other Revenue per SBN drivers (e.g., Port Revenue, Land Revenue, etc.) over the forecast period, net of inflation on vessel-level expenses

•
SG&A: reflects impact of baseline increases in costs in addition to the additional burden of investments in RPP and direct capabilities (~$24M of run-rate costs in '28E
associated with Direct expansion, including $18M of incremental marketing spend)

•
FCF & Other: includes impact of free cash flow generation (~$479M over our hold period excluding $150M dividend recap proceeds and assumes interim distributions from excess cash
above 2.0x net leverage), mandatory debt amortization paydown, and MIP dilution

•

Alpha 1: reflects (i) accelerated new vessel growth via the launch of 4 additional new vessels in EU between '27E-'28E (including Base Case, total new vessels in EU of +9
vs whitespace analysis of additional ~50) and (ii) direct channel mix expanding from 15% > 30% from '26E to '28E with the additional increase of Occupancy Rate to
90% by '28 and increase of attach rates on upsell revenue by 20% from ~38% in '24E to ~45% in '28E

\> Ama's fleet is comprised of three different vessel structures: 100% owned, Chartered, and JV

· Ama utilizes charter and JV agreements in certain geographies given local operator expertise and access to river permits and licenses

· For JVs, Ama is a 50% owner in the ship and its stake is earned via prepayments into the JV entity for ~2-years leading into the launch

" Over the course of the first five years of sailing, the prepaid balance is drawn down via reduction in the charter cost fees that Ama pays to its JV
partners to operate the ships

" Ama charters the vessel from and pays a fee to the JV, who earns a small profit based on the difference between the charter rate (paid by Ama) and
the JV's operating expenses - excess profits are then dividended out to the shareholders of the JV (of which Ama is 50% of), which we've
conservatively modeled as $500k per annum, despite increased JV vessels through the forecast period

· Three of Ama's 100% owned vessels are chartered to APT, who has exclusivity to market and distribute to the Australia/NZ market

· APT charter agreement and exclusivity expires in 2025, at which point Ama will integrate the three vessels into its fleet and begin to operate them

(1) 2027 vessel counts reflect Management's estimates. APT Charter vessels included within 100% Owned column. The 1 incremental Chartered vessel and 3 incremental JV vessels are contracted.

Ama's top 3 rivers (~87% of capacity) grew consistently from 2017-2019; while 2022 Occupancy Rates
negatively impacted margins, 2023 occupancy has improved with 2024 bookings hinting a strong recovery

Lower discounting in 2019 drove material increases in Total Net Revenue ("TNR") per Sold Bednight ("SBN") and expanded VLEBITDA Margin

Vessel-level economics are highly attractive with significant flow through on pricing and incremental
passengers and low break-even Occupancy Rates


### Illustrative Economics (Based on AmaLea 7-Day Trip with 2023A profile)

Increases to NCY (gross price or
reduction in discounts and
commissions) are 100% flow through to
VLEBITDA

Increase in 1 passenger increases SBN
and translates to a 78% flow through to
VLEBITDA

Breakeven Occupancy Rate for AmaLea
is ~30%

<td>Category The global premium River Cruise category is fundamentally attractive</td>
<td>&gt; Demand trends are favorable &gt; Little existential or disruptive threat exists from category dynamics (e.g., water-levels) &gt; Category exhibits resilience or strong recovery across economic cycles and geopolitical incidents</td>
<td>&gt; River Cruise is ~$7B growing ~5-7% p.a., with premium and luxury ~60% of total and growing faster &gt; Most threats are minor or mitigatable, other than geopolitical concerns - current EMEA conflicts expected to have small impact to Ama given EU river focus and while '15-'16 terrorist attacks impacted forward bookings for Ama, the Company showed rapid recovery in '18 &gt; While there is cyclicality risk in the category, it is resilient relative to other discretionary categories and predictable / manageable - during the '08-'09 recession, River Cruise experienced a 15-20% decrease in revenues predominantly driven by price, however, the typical cycle is expected to be milder with a 4-8% decrease in revenues &gt; Downside Case assumes 600bps decline in Occupancy and -5% in NCY (lower than McK range) and yields 2.1x MOIC and 17% IRR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Brand Ama delivers am experience that drives strong consumer affinity</td>
<td>&gt; The Ama brand is sufficiently strong for a direct marketing strategy to drive greater loyalty</td>
<td>&gt; Given low awareness of only 55% (vs Viking at 91%) coupled with strong consumer affinity and satisfaction (NPS and FPI are amongst highest of premium peers and #2 behind Viking), additional direct marketing investments should drive awareness, elevate and support Ama's premium positioning, and translate into greater loyalty › Additionally, consumer survey signifies stronger loyalty for Ama - 26% of Ama's cruisers have repeated only with Ama (vs. 18% avg. for peers) and 54% of first-time cruisers sailing with Ama have repeated (vs. 36% avg. for peers) &gt; Base Case assumes increases in marketing spend as a % of Total Net Revenue from 5.5% in 2024 to 7.5% in 2028</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Distribution There is meaningful opportunity by building a direct strategy that manages channel conflicts</td>
<td>&gt; Travel agent channel remains relevant and healthy</td>
<td>&gt; Travel agents remain both healthy (top 5 travel consortia comprise ~70% share and rebounded strongly from COVID) and a critical channel (~70-90% of river bookings), driven by complexity, higher commissions, and older consumer demographic</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; Expansion of direct can support occupancy growth &amp; vessel expansion &gt; Analogues exist for building a vessel profit-accretive strategy while avoiding channel conflicts</td>
<td>&gt; As proven by Viking (est. ~ 50% direct), direct channel expansion enables (i) improvements to Occupancy Rates (drive last-minute and off-peak season bookings, market new vessels and itineraries), (ii) greater RPP growth (earlier bookings with lower discounts, improvements in upsell attach rates, reduced commissions), (iii) structural loyalty (greater repeat rates, higher LTV / efficiency on marketing spend), and (iv) enhanced strategic / enterprise value &gt; Base Case assumes we invest in direct capabilities (high gap today) to support VCP levers with a minor shift in mix (10%-&gt;15%) to unlock optionality on Alpha via direct channel expansion (without cannibalizing the travel agent channel given expected capacity growth)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Whitespace and Vessel Growth There is sufficient whitespace for Ama to capitalize on demand opportunity</td>
<td>&gt; Whitespace exists for Ama to continue growing vessels in existing geographies/itineraries (25-&gt;33 in Base Case) &gt; Supply dynamics are unlikely to constrain Ama from capitalizing on demand opportunity</td>
<td>&gt; Whitespace analysis indicates ~50 additional global vessel opportunity long-term (primarily in Europe), though pure new whitespace limited; additionally diligence confirmed that Ama's primary rivers will be able to support additional vessels with limited operational constraints " Core EU rivers: significant opportunity to (i) grow vessel count with conservative Base Case assumption of +5 in EU and (ii) increase frequency of trips (Ama has more itineraries than Viking (~35 vs ~25) but less trips per itinerary) " Non-EU Rivers: opportunity for Ama to expand presence (Mekong, Nile, Chobe, Magdalena) and drive structural loyalty (EU rivers are the "gateway" to exotic destinations), which have historically seen 90-100% occupancy rates. Base Case assumes +3 in non-EU &gt; Similar to Ama, most brands outsource onboard labor due to complexity of compliance across jurisdictions - Ama's primary partners (Sea Chefs and Rivertech) act as an extension of the Company, are financially healthy, and can scale with Ama &gt; Minimal capacity constraints for shipyards for Ama's partners (Vahali and Teamco)</td>

<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Revenue per Passenger ("RPP") Clear initiatives exist to drive RPP</td>
<td>&gt; Multiple levers exist to drive RPP (and profitability), which can be supported or enabled by direct channel expansion (if necessary) via primary data and direct relationships with consumers</td>

Additionally, Ama and its travel agents do not leverage customer data to target customers with customized offerings nor target customers closer to embarkation dates for solicit upsell attachment &gt; Commercial diligence findings show ~4% revenue uplift potential from improvements to revenue management based on avg uplift observed across other capacity-based industries (e.g., hotels, airlines, and passenger rail)</td>

## Trends Driving Consumer Demand for River Cruises


<table>
<tr>
<th>Drivers</th>
<th>Next 5 years</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shift in consumer demographics and desires</td>
<td>1 The core river cruising demographic is forecasted to grow at an unprecedented speed (e.g., 14% p.a. '23-'30F), wealth within this demographic likely to keep rising (e.g., delayed retirement) Furthermore, as river cruises expand to new demographics such as younger cruisers and families (e.g., CrosiEurope offers free trips for kids), demand for river cruises will rise</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rise of non-US river cruisers</td>
<td>1 Share of river cruisers coming from outside the US is rising, particularly in EU, Asia and Oceania (e.g., Phoenix Reisen, a German targeted brand, forecasts 15% capacity increase '23-'24)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Premiumization of the travel experience</td>
<td>1 Continued rise of luxury segment offerings in river cruises is leading to a higher $/person (e.g., Scenic from the ultra- luxury tier forecasted to grow 13% '20-'24F vs. 1% for market)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Increased marketing / awareness</td>
<td>Similar growth in DTC marketing is unlikely in the future given 1) not many river cruising brands have the scale of Viking and 2) river cruises are already benefiting from Viking's investment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Evolving preferences around safety of cruises</td>
<td>Preferences for health and safety are likely to remain in the future, though impact on river cruise demand may diminish over time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pent up COVID- demand</td>
<td>Enduring shift in consumer psychology around consumer experiences and increase in time spent at home leading to minimal step increase in consumer's desire to travel</td>

## Few disruptive threats exist from inherent category dynamics


<table>
<tr>
<th>Threats</th>
<th>Impact on River Cruise Market</th>
<th>Degree of Threat</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changes in water levels</td>
<td>High and low water are the main driver of trip interruption (e.g., water too high causing ship blockage at bridges, water too low making it impossible to sail)</td>
<td>☐ Most cruises mitigated navigability issues via strategic itinerary planning (e.g., 2 boats meeting at choking point)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Over-tourism</td>
<td>Increased pushback from local communities creates a growing problem, particularly in small ill-equipped ports leading to regulations being put in place (e.g., daily passenger limits)</td>
<td>☐ Better itinerary coordination could alleviate over-crowding in many ports, future growth may be limited</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Limited river and dock capacity</td>
<td>Saturation of river / dock capacity on popular rivers is rising as a challenge, particularly as companies seek to expand the number of active trips</td>
<td>☐ Larger cruise brands are investing in infrastructure (e.g., proprietary docks, preferential docking privileges)</td>
</tr>

While the series of terrorist attacks from 2015 to 2016 impacted forward bookings initially, Ama quickly recovered by September,
driven by the ability to cost-effectively reduce vessels in operations coupled with pricing actions with absolute bookings up 36% YoY,
suggesting both the resilience of the industry and Ama's consumer demand.

The company has not provided financial data from this period as Ama did not produce consolidated financial statements until mid-2017

## The river cruise category is relatively resilient to macroeconomic cyclicality

•
River cruisers are
less impacted by a
recessionary
environment given
the customer
demographic over-
indexes on high net
worth individuals
with greater
disposable income
and financial security

•
Luxury goods, which
is comparable to
river cruising, has
historically proven
resilient given the
high net worth of
consumers

•
Most river cruise
bookings are made
in the year prior to
travel with initial
deposits due upon
booking and full
payment due months
in advance,
providing high
visibility to revenues
and insulation from
cancellations

•
The global ocean
cruise industry is an
analogue to river
cruises and has been
resilient to past
macroeconomic
shocks with
consistent growth in
passengers in every
year from 1980-2019

### Expert Interviews on Forward Bookings

"By the time the recession hits, the people travelling
have already booked and paid, several months in
advance"

Expert #1

"People will still cruise during recessions because they
booked the cruise a year ago; they may still book
during recessions because they're planning a year
ahead"

Expert #2

### Downside

Projections

What you have to believe


#### Projections


### What you have to believe

Change in
occupancy, %

Occupancy would decrease about half as
much as for river cruise during the severe
'08-'09 recession (-5-8%)

-3%

Change in
daily
revenue per
passenger, %

-4%

Promotions and discounts are about half
those ocean cruises during '00-'01
recession (-7%) given higher ability to park
ships and desire to maintain price premium in
river cruises

-5%

Promotions and discounts are about half
those of river cruise during '08-'09
recession (-10-12%) due to the general
robustness of demand and stronger
macroeconomic outlook vs, '08-'09

Change in
total
revenues, %

-4%

-8%

"Price typically isn't that important of a factor when picking.
These people care about value, they want a good
luxury experience, but the price isn't top of mind"
Regional Sales Director, River Cruise

"Lots of the river cruise clientele are 55 or 60+. They
have investments and plenty of disposable income and don't
change their spending habits much when the economy tanks"
Former Director of Field Sales

"High net worth, high income individuals are less likely to
be impacted during a recession and will continue to travel"
Expert in River Cruise

Our Downside Case reflects a ~600bps decline in Occupancy Rate and a -5% decline in Net Cruise Revenue in 2025E, reflecting more conservative
assumptions than those presented in McKinsey's downside case above (see P29 for additional detail)

Source: Mckinsey

(1) Demand grew by +18% for Royal Caribbean and +29% for Carnival in 2011, boosted by capacity growth (+20% for Royal Caribbean with launch of 4 new ships, +10% for Carnival with launch of 2 new ships) and
M&A (+22% Royal Caribbean)

Confidential
28

0%

Occupancy would not be impacted given
luxury / premium focus of river cruises vs.
ocean cruises (during '00-'01 recession,
ocean cruises saw a 2% decline when
excluding capacity growth and M&A)(1)

We have modeled a Downside Case that assumes 2025/2026 bookings are impacted, with recovery in 2027
and 2028, yielding a 2.1x MOIC and 17% IRR

## Assumptions

1
Occupancy Rate: assumes decline to
~81% in 2025 that reflects the impact of
an adverse shock (i.e., deep recession,
geopolitical event, terrorist attack, etc.);
lingering impact in 2026 (vs. Base Case
87% and 88% in 2025 and 2026,
respectively), with recovery in outer
years to match Base Case ~88% in 2028

2
Net Cruise Yield: projects -5% Net
Cruise Yield decline in 2025 (vs. Base
Case of +2% growth), assuming lower
net pricing (via reduced ticket prices and
higher discounting) is required to
increase occupancy in a downturn;
assumes slight growth in 2026 and +3.0-
+3.5% annual growth in outer years.
Net Cruise Yield reaches $455 in 2028
(vs. Base Case $502)

3
VLEBITDA Margin: assumes +260bps
of % margin expansion (vs. Base Case
+600bps)

4
Adj. EBITDA Margin: conservatively
assumes +150bps of Adj. EBITDA
Margin % growth (vs. Base Case
+570bps), as flow through impact of
slow Net Cruise Yield recovery limits
margin expansion

5
Returns: yields a 2.1x MOIC and 17%
IRR

(1)
Customer Deposits excluded from leverage metrics.

(2)
Represents levered Free Cash Flow defined as Net Income + D&A + Change in NWC - Capex.

Travel agents represent ~70-90% of river cruise bookings today and will remain a key channel for river
cruises as travel agents provide a range of benefits to consumers and operators, particularly in premium


## Travel Agents Remain a Key Channel for River Cruises and Ama

Travel Agents
Across Broader
Travel

The travel agent channel will remain important in overall travel:

\> The number of travel agents saw a dip during COVID and has started to rebound since; while it may not fully go back to pre-COVID levels, it is expected to recover
and stabilize in coming years

\> Travel agent usage is particularly high for higher-spend / luxury travel; as luxury travel continues to rise, usage of travel agents is likely to follow

Travel Agents
Among River
Cruises

Travel agents are likely to remain even more important in river cruises than in other travel experiences

› Usage of travel agents is much higher among specialized experiences, in particular river cruises; river cruisers also indicate higher likelihood to using travel
agents in the future, even for lower-spend vacations

\> The need for travel agents from river cruisers seems largely due to their lack of knowledge of brands / tours - which we expect to remain low in coming years given
niche positioning of the industry and high fragmentation

River cruises are also highly attractive to agents due to high commissions and strong customer satisfaction, with share of river cruise among travel agent bookings
(currently at 7%) expected to grow in the future

DTC offers advantages, but requires scale and investment, though Ama has already begun to invest in these
capabilities with early promising success


## DTC Benefits and Investment Required


### Strengthening the DTC Channel Yields Several Benefits ...

•

A

Healthy net revenue expansion as DTC does not require
commission fees, which are typically ~15- 18% of gross sale value

•

B
Occupancy improvements driven by better ability to capture last
minute bookings and tailor offerings based on a more robust
consumer database (CRM)

•
C
Full control of end-to-end experience with better informed sales
reps (vs. travel agents) and direct consumer relationships-building
brand loyalty


### ... but Many Players are Hesitant to do so Given Capital and New Capabilities Needed

•

D
Substantial marketing investment, with high initial costs to
grow awareness and ongoing expenses to continue to drive the
sales funnel

•

E
Development of an online DTC platform, with startup and
maintenance of back-end infrastructure as well as front-end
website / UX

•
F
Expansion of existing call centers and training programs to
manage high volume of DTC bookings

(",
"Almost everyone has a call center, but you would need 3-4x as many people to
handle direct bookings - you're basically hiring in-house travel agents"
\- Owner and general manager, travel agency

•
Continued, strong demand
growth given high consumer
awareness, abundance of
marquee cities, and ability to
sail larger ships (i.e., more
capacity / ship)
Capacity growth in Rhine may
be limited by fewer docking
spaces and relocation of vessels
to industrial harbors (e.g., in
Amsterdam), as well as low water
in popular stretches

•
Modest demand growth given
seasonality
(e.g., Spring tulips in Dutch /
Belgium regions) and moderate
number of landmarks

•
Muted growth given low
awareness of Western EU rivers,
with providers also hesitating to
add vessels given high
frequency of low water
(especially Elbe, Garonne /
Dordogne)

(1) Based on bednights capacity from CIN and assumes 2023 occupancy for all rivers is ~87% today, based on expert survey (N = 11).

Ama offers more
itineraries than most
peers, but Viking has
considerably higher
trip frequency, leading
consumers to perceive
Viking as offering
more options (i.e.,
given ability to offer
many departures) - to be
validated with panel survey

Other peers (e.g.,
Avalon) have higher
number of itineraries
due to theme
customization (e.g.,
Germany "for beer
enthusiasts", "WWII
Remembrance and
History" itineraries,
"Tulip Time" in
Holland and Belgium)

Source: Mckinsey; Note: Numbers may not sum across rows to brand total as itineraries that cross multiple rivers (e.g., Rhine and Danube) are double counted. Itineraries defined by distinct names displayed on websites,
which may include those that follow the same routes but offer different customizations (e.g., Danube vs. Danube "for wine lovers")

(1) Includes only rivers with 400+ trips in 2023 total across all brands and with over 100,000 bednights capacity in 2023. Rivers are listed in order of 2023 total river cruise bednights capacity.

(2)
Removed itineraries that cross rivers where no trip data was displayed for that brand in CIN market report (i.e., Avalon / Douro, Uniworld / Rhone, where itineraries were minimal of <.

(3)
Trip data based on CIN market report and does not include trips where brands cross combinations of rivers, if the individual rivers are also listed out separately. Providers may offer additional trips that cross these rivers

## Rivertech


### Key Insights

\> Ama considers Seachefs and Rivertech as
longstanding, close partners and has never
re-evaluated them as vendors - we will
compare against other providers post-
closing (e.g., RFP)

\> Diligence suggest outsourcing operations
is typical for smaller river cruise
companies; Seachefs is considered a large,
reputable provider in the industry while
Rivertech has partnered with Ama since
inception

\> Additionally, Ama's outsourced operating

### Key Observations

› Key criteria for shipyard selection include:
cost, available slots, ways of working,
'progressive/innovative' approach, and
quality of relationships

\> Ama partnered with Vahali shipyard
throughout most of its history, but
transitioned projects exclusively to
TeamCo in 2019 who is now the
Company's go-forward partner

\> Ama's shift to TeamCo was primarily
driven by the need for a visionary partner
to work with them on developing the next
generation of river cruise vessels

\> Throughout Ama's history, the Company
has not experienced any issues with partner
shipyards delivering vessels on time and on
budget

\> Importantly, management indicated that
they have no concerns around availability
of slots at TeamCo and are in frequent
communications with RiverTech and
TeamCo personnel regarding future
planning

Ama currently sets itinerary prices' ~2 years prior to sailing, and utilizes a variety of promotion and
discounting tactics to meet Occupancy Rate and Total Net Revenue targets


<figure>

Itineraries and sailings are set, 'brochure
price' is set (typically 3-5% inflation YOY) -
not considering competitor pricing, prior
year occupancy, or profitability

Other groups (e.g., affinity
groups) typically book
(usually via agent), giving
further demand signals

FIT bookings fill in remainder of available capacity,
shaped by strategic decisions to increase/decrease
discounting; do not offer heavy 'last minute' discounts
as travel agents typically try to get retroactive
discounts for clients if prices drop

~18-24 months out

24+ months out

~12-18 months out

Date of Sailing

Charter groups (e.g., Disney, Backroads) typically
booked (via direct sales), giving early reads on demand;
typically offer ~30% discount off 'brochure price' at
100% occupancy

Early bird booking
discounts offered to FIT's
(typically 5% for peak
season, 20% for
shoulder season)

35-40% of Ama's business comes from groups
and partners, whereas competitors, such as
Viking, are more FIT-focused; as a result, Ama
does not have to discount as aggressively given
early base loading of occupancy

Management meets every 2 weeks throughout the year to track demand (by itinerary and sailing month) to identify opportunities to shape demand via increasing /
decreasing promotional and marketing activities (eg., percent savings, free land) - and, in some cases; to determine whether to cancel embarkations

<td>Depending on demand, select sailings are identified as ideal for %/$ variable discount or increase, which ultimately funnels demand</td>

Commercial and Operations DD findings suggest material opportunities exist to drive Revenue per
Passenger driven by immaturity across various processes and functions


<table>
<tr>
<th>Opportunity</th>
<th>Commentary</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">General Pricing</td>
<td>&gt; Currently, Ama sets a "brochure price" for each itinerary (typically 3-5% inflation YoY) and adjusts promotional offerings based on demand closer to sailing date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; The Company does not consider competitor pricing, prior year occupancy, or profitability in setting the brochure price</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3">Discounting and Promotions</td>
<td>&gt; There are four different types of discounts that the company uses: 1) early booking discounts for 3-6 months 2) %/$ variable discounts 3) 'amenity' discounts &amp; promotions not related to cruise (i.e. land) 4) standardized add-on rates (i.e. airfare); 'amenity' discounts and promotions are high performing compared to dollar discounts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; For Viking, discounting is excluded for most cruise-related pricing with mainly free or standard rate air packages and returning guest discount offerings; compared to Ama's percentage discounts, Viking's promotional strategy allows for repeat customers and higher attach rates</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; Through further direct expansion, Ama can achieve lower discount rates by stimulating consumer demand earlier in the selling season, thereby reducing the need to discount to drive target Occupancy rates, resulting in higher NCY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Commissions</td>
<td>&gt; Ama's current direct capabilities are in very early innings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; Through further direct expansion, Ama can achieve lower effective commission rates, resulting in higher NCY</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="4">Upsell Revenue</td>
<td>&gt; Upsell revenue per bednight is up across most itineraries from 2019 to 2023, with newly introduced itineraries having significant upsell; however, upsell revenue by itinerary varies dramatically, suggesting opportunity to drive incremental revenue especially on similar Rhine and Danube routes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; Currently Ama does not directly target customers that haven't purchased add-ons while Viking leverages customer data to sell excursion and pre/post packages based on interests and preferences</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; There remains ample opportunity to further work with travel agents and DTC to target customers closer to embarkation dates with offers as well as potential to create pre-packaged pre / post options</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; Personalized add-ons and additions of optional luxury shore excursions may also premiumize the experience and drive upsell revenue growth</td>

# Overview of Diligence Adjustments

1\. Owners' bonuses and Certares fee: removes bonuses paid to three owners and
management fees paid to the Company's current sponsors, Certares, plus any
payroll taxes on these amounts. Refined management's adjustment to capture the
payroll taxes on the bonuses in FY23 which had not been adjusted

2\. One-time professional fees: adds back ~$0.2m of transaction expenses in FY23
in connection with this sale process (i.e., research study, transfer pricing advising,
and dataroom costs among other one-off costs)

3\. Unrealized FX charges: removes unrealized (non-cash) FX-charges from
EBITDA related to currency revaluations for entries posted in non-functional
financial statements (US LLC and European GmBH entity) in USD

4\. Employee retention credit: removes income recognized on the employee
retention credits (ERC) received as part of COVID-19 relief as this is a one-time
benefit

5\. Staff bonus normalization: normalizes staff bonuses to reflect actual payout for
FY21-22, accrued for ratably throughout the year

6\. Out of period adjustments: adjustment to correct various true-up entries posted
at year-end or in Q1 of the subsequent year and record them in the periods to
which they relate. Included i) insurance claims received in 2023 related to 2022
and prior ii) write-off of a VAT receivable related to 2020 charter revenues and
iii) various other ship operating expense accruals (i.e., maintenance costs)

7\. Audit adjustments: placeholder for any adjustments resulting from an audit of
the FY'23 financial statements, which is expected to be completed in April 2024

vs. $116M prior, driven almost entirely by unfavorable FX
(mostly unrealized; forecasted at 1.08 vs 1.10 on 12/31 and 1.08 today)
