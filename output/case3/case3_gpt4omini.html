Deck argues entry will stay limited; conviction level: high.</li></ul><p>Substitution Risks</p><ul><li>Alternative Vacation Formats<br />• <span style='color: green; font-weight: normal;'>Ocean cruises, escorted land tours, and luxury rail noted only in passing;

narrative implies moderate switching friction once a guest sails.</li></ul><p>Barriers to Entry</p><ul><li>Capital &amp; Permits<br />• ~$26 M build cost per vessel + multi-year shipyard queue + river docking rights positioned as sizable barriers; tone: definitive.</li><li>Brand &amp; Distribution<br />• Travel-agent relationships and “low consumer awareness” stated as exploitable moat; <span style='color: green; font-weight: normal;'>deck claims agents still drive 70-90 % of bookings</span> <span style='color: red;
