references Viking benchmark (~50 %) to validate upside.</li><li>Layered alpha levers—luxury co-branded products with LVMH, cross-sell into “exotic” rivers, and tuck-in M&amp;A (e.g., Aqua Expeditions) positioned as optional but incremental.</li><li>Exit multiple expansion narrative relies on strategic buyers valuing larger fleet &amp; higher direct share; presented as credible given scarcity of scaled, premium river assets.</li></ul><p>Operational Improvements</p><ul><li>Revenue management overhaul (pricing, discount discipline, upsell attach rates) called “immature today” with third-party benchmarks citing ~4 % lift; plan deemed low-risk, high ROI.</li><li>Marketing spend reallocated to top-funnel brand building (rise to 7.5 % of revenue) plus call-center scale-up; cost framed as “run-rate $24 M by ’28” with explicit pay-back via lower commissions.</li><li>Fixed/variable cost leverage via higher occupancy (76 % → 88 %) and modest shoulder-season deployment;
